# day-planner

DESCRIPTION:

In this homework assignement we were tasked to create a day planner that applied real time using moment.js. When you open the site you can then see the description and then the real time and date displayed by moment.js. jquery loads 1 row with 3 md col then itterates through the work hours of 9-5 and creates a row for each hour totaling 9 identical rows. jquery and css then apply color coding to each individual block depending on if they are in the past(grey) present(red) future(green). As stated, the first col represents the hour of the dayfor that time block. the second col is the text area where the user logs their task which then can be saved to local storage by the button element in the third col.
